# My Portfolio v3

This is the third version of my personal portfolio, built with modern web technologies. It showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a web developer.

## 🚀 About This Project

This portfolio is a single-page application built with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. It features a clean and modern design, with a focus on user experience and performance. The data is currently hardcoded and will be replaced with a proper backend in the future.

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Design:** The portfolio is fully responsive and works on all devices.
- **Modern UI:** The UI is built with shadcn/ui components, providing a clean and modern look.
- **Animations:** The portfolio features subtle animations to enhance the user experience.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** The codebase is organized into reusable components, making it easy to maintain and scale.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Vite:** For fast development and builds
- **React:** For building the user interface
- **TypeScript:** For static typing
- **TailwindCSS:** For utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui:** For accessible and customizable components
- **ESLint:** For code linting
- **Prettier:** For code formatting

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/who-am-i.git
cd who-am-i
npm install
```

Then, start the development server:

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to see the result.

## 📦 Building for Production

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the production-ready files.

## 🎨 Using shadcn/ui

To add new components from shadcn/ui, run the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]
```

For example, to add the `input` component, run:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add input
```

This will add the `input.tsx` file to the `src/components/ui` directory.

## 📖 ESLint and Prettier

This starter pack is configured with ESLint and Prettier to ensure code quality and consistency.

To lint your code, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To format your code, run:

```bash
